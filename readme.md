Simply go to the releases.

You will get a warning/halt when running `dkit.exe`. This is because of a feature Microsoft uses called Microsoft SmartScreen. To get rid of this for all users, I'd have to purchase an EV or an OV, otherwise known as certificates. The source for this code is all public, and the executable has exactly **zero** protection, so even a child could reverse it. Read [**this post**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48946680/how-to-avoid-the-windows-defender-smartscreen-prevented-an-unrecognized-app-fro/66582477#66582477) for a better idea of how much it would take to stop SmartScreen.
