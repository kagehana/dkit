# Installation
Simply go to the [**releases**](https://github.com/kagehana/dkit/releases) and install the latest version.

# Disclaimer
You will get a warning when running `dkit.exe`. This is because of a feature Microsoft uses called [**Microsoft SmartScreen**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/). To get rid of this for all users, I'd have to purchase an **EV** or **OV**, otherwise known as certificates. The source for this code is all public, and the executable has exactly **zero** protection, so even a child could reverse it. Read [**this post**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48946680/how-to-avoid-the-windows-defender-smartscreen-prevented-an-unrecognized-app-fro/66582477#66582477) for a better idea of how much it would take to stop **SmartScreen**.
